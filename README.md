<h1>Project back in development</h1>
<h3><b>All breaking issues seem to be taken care of, for now...</b></h3>
<p>I have some more time now so I can work on this and add/fix all the features that I had planned initially.</p>

<h1>This project is still in development</h1>
<p>Although this page is published and is usable, in its current state it does not represent a finished product. If you have any issue, suggestion, or feature request please post them in the Issues tab</p>


<h1>Trials in Tainted Space Save Editor</h1>
<p>A Save Editor for the JavaScript version of Trials in Tainted Space. When finished, this editor will most likely end up functioning similarly to <a href="https://github.com/end5/CoC2-Save-Editor">CoC2's Save Editor</a>.</p>
